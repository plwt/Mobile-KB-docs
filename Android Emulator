Firefox for Android (Android Studio Emulator)

This will help you to have a useable copy of Firefox for Android running on a desktop or laptop computer running Linux, macOS or Windows.  Please note that this method does involve some large downloads and may take some to set up initially.  Running an app in an Android Virtual Device can be quite taxing on a computer, so it is worthwhile closing any other apps you have open.

Install the latest version of Android Studio from either your operating systems app store or from https://developer.android.com/studio.  This will be a very large download and may take some time.
